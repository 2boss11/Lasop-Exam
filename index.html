      <h1>JavaScript</h1>
     <p> 1. Generate a random number between 0 and 255 inclusively</p>

     
     const random_number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
     
     console.log(random_number);
        <!-- 2 -->

       <p> 2. Use the Date object to do the following activities </p>
       <p> 1. What is the year today? </p>
       <p> 2. What is the month today as a number?</p>
       <p> 3. What is the date today?</p>
       <p> 4. What is the day today as a number?</p>
        <p>5. What is the hours now?</p>
        <p>  6. What is the minutes now?</p>


        <!-- 3 -->

        <p>3. Using prompt get the year the user was born and if the user is 18 or above allow
            the user to drive if not tell the user to wait a certain amount of years.
            </p>

            <!-- 4  -->

    <p>4. Create a human readable time format using the Date time object
                1. YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
                2. DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm
                3. DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm </p>

                <!-- 5 -->


     <p>5. Get user input using prompt (“Enter your age”). If user is 18 or older, give feedback:
                    'Youare old enough to drive' but if not 18 give another feedback stating to wait for the
                    number of years he needs to turn 18.</p>


                    <!-- 6 -->
      <p>  6. Compare the values of myAge and yourAge using if … else. Based on the comparison
                        and log the result to console stating who is older (me or you). Use prompt (“Enter
                        yourage:”) to get the age as input. </p>

                            <!-- 7 -->
     <p>7. If a is greater than b return 'a is greater than b' else 'a is less than b'. Try to implement it
                            in to ways
                            I. Using ternary operator
                            II. Using if and else </p>

                            <!-- 8 -->
    <p> 8. Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check, if a
                            number is even or not using JavaScript</p>

                            <!-- Part B -->

o December, January or February, the season is Winter.
o March, April or May, the season is Spring
o June, July or August, the season is Summer</p>

<!-- Part B 4 -->
<p>4. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all numbers.</p>


<!-- part B 5 -->

<p>5. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all
    odds.</p>
<!-- Part B 6 -->

<p>6. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum
    of all odds. Print sum of evens and sum of odds as array
    Iterate through the array, ["HTML", "CSS", "JS", "React", "Redux", "Node",
    "Express", "MongoDB"] using a for or while loop to print out the items. </p>

    <!--Part B 7 -->
    <p>7. This is a fruit array , ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon'] reverse the order using
    loop without using a reverse method.</p>


<!-- Pat C -->
<h1>Part C</h1>
<p>1. Explain the difference between forEach, map, filter, and reduce.</p>
<p>1. The forEach method doesn't return a new array, but it can be used to modify the original array.
    The map method returns a new array with the same length as the original array.
    The filter method returns a new array with only the elements that satisfy the provided condition.
    The reduce method returns a single value that is the accumulated result of the callback function.</p>



    <!-- REACTJS -->
    <h1>Part D</h1>
1.  a) Open-source JavaScript back-end library
2.  b) Props
3.  b) 1 Element
4.  b) When a component is created for the first time
5.  a) props
6.  c) Cannot be changed in the component

8.  d. Error   
9.  b. 8080
10. b. "Key" prop is a way for React to identify a newly added item in a list and compare it
during the "diffing" algorithm.
